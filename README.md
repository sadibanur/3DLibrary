# 3DLibrary

This program creates a 3D scenes and saving them to the STL file format. It involves writing a C library that can be used to create in-memory data structures that represent scenes in 3-dimensional space. After creating 3D scenes, the library will have the ability to save/write these scenes to a file format known as STL (Standard Triangle Language).
